# Northstar by Leap Motion Assembly Guide
Assembling the North Star Augmented Reality headset by Leap Motion using easily available parts within the United States.

## Introduction

In June 2018 Leap Motion [made public](http://blog.leapmotion.com/north-star-open-source/) their design of an Augmented Reality headset. While the original designs require some parts that are not publicly availible in small batches, enthusiasts all over the world  attempted to modify the design to make it easier to assemble. The most successful to date was the japanese exiii Inc. The main modification they made was the replacement of hard to find LCD screens with raspberry pi touchscreens. They also had to modify some 3D-printer designs to accomodate the new setup. I used their designs and found substitutes readily availible in the US to assemble the headset and would like to share my journey for others to build upon.

## Sourcing The Parts

- STL Files (except for the lenses)
All the files I used 

- The Lenses
 Thanks to @Eric in the Discord channel we have a high res mesh for those who want to 3D print the lenses. I have reflected his design to produce the left lense as well. Please find the files in this repo.
## Assembly Tips

### Video 
Here is the video of how this particular headset was assembled. It is by no means the only way to do it but such material would have helped me a lot when I started out and I hope you find it to be a good refernce point.

## Software

Currently working on this part. Stay tuned!
